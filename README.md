## One of my Blog Sites

This is a blog site for my personal use. I use it to write down my thoughts and ideas. I also use it to record my learning process. I hope it can help me to improve my English writing skills.

### How to use it

1. Write down your ideas in the `content` folder.
2. Run `hugo` to generate the static site.
3. Upload the static site to your server.

### How to write a new post

1. Create a new file in the `content` folder.
2. Write down your ideas in the file.
3. Add the following header to the file:

    ```markdown
    ---
    title: "Title of the post"
    date: 2018-01-01T00:00:00+08:00
    draft: false
    ---
    ```
4. Run `hugo` to generate the static site.
5. Upload the static site to your server.


Oh enough!
